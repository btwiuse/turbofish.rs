# turbo.fish

A little joke website about a piece of syntax in the [Rust Programming Language][rust-lang.org].

The name "turbofish" was made up by reddit user deadstone in 2015 ([reddit thread][]), and has
since caught on in the Rust community, being used even in the [official documentation][docs].

For information about what the turbofish does and when you should use it, take a look at
[this blog post][blog-post].
